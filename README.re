📁 ad_google_reo_files
Welcome to the ad_google_reo_files repository! This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and notebooks created using Google Colab. It serves as a centralized location to store, share, and revisit various machine learning models, data analyses, and coding experiments done in Colab.

📌 About
This repository contains:

Google Colab notebooks from various personal and academic projects

Python-based data science, machine learning, and deep learning experiments

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks

Miscellaneous experiments or prototypes developed using Google Colab


Each subfolder contains one or more .ipynb files along with any necessary files for that specific project.

💻 Getting Started
You can open and run any of the notebooks using Google Colab. Click the Colab badge below or upload the notebook to Google Colab.


📈 Topics Covered
Some of the topics you may find here:

Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)

Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

Natural Language Processing

Time Series Analysis

Web Scraping and APIs

🚧 Work in Progress
This is a living repository, and I will keep adding more Colab files as I complete new projects.
